DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

2. Movie Rating Prediction
This project predicts movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors.
It uses regression models to estimate how a movie might be rated by users or critics.
Categorical data is preprocessed using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.
The goal is to explore feature engineering and build a model that accurately predicts ratings.
It demonstrates how machine learning can analyze entertainment industry trends.

3. Iris Flower Classification
This project uses the famous Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
It is based on sepal and petal length and width measurements.
A machine learning classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression or SVM) is trained on this data.
The model learns patterns and predicts the correct species for new flower measurements.
It serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to supervised learning and model evaluation.

4. Sales Prediction
This project predicts product sales using advertising spend data from TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
A Linear Regression model was built with an RÂ² score of 0.91, showing high prediction accuracy.
EDA showed TV ads had the strongest influence on sales, while Newspaper had the least.
The project includes correlation analysis, model evaluation, and visualization of actual vs predicted sales.
